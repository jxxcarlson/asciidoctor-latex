# Test doc: samples/env.adoc


# EnvironmentBlock is a first draft for a better
# way of handing a construct in Asciidoc that
# will map to LaTeX environments.  See
# issue #1 in asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex.
#
# The code below is based on @mojavelinux's
# outline. The EnvironmentBlock is called
# into action (please ... give me a more
# precise phrase here!) when text
# of the form [env.foo] is encountered.
# This is the signal to create a block
# of type environment. (Is this correct?)
# and environment-type "foo"
#
# In the act of creating an environment
# block, information extracted from
# [env.foo] is used to title the block
# as "Foo n", where n is a counter for
# environments of type "foo".  The
# counter is created in a hash the first
# time an environment of that kind
# is encountered.  We set
#
#    counter["foo"] = 1
#
# Subsequent encounters cause the
# counter to be incremented.
#
# Later, when the backend process the AST,
# the information bundled by the
# EnvironmentBlock is used as is
# appropriate. In the case of conversion
# to LaTeX, the content of the block
# simply enclosed in delimiters as
# follows:
#
# \begin{foo} CONTENT \end{foo}
#
# Additionally, label information
# for cross-referencing is added at
# this stage.
#
# If, on the other hand, the backend
# is HTML, then the title (with numbering)
# that is extracted from [env.foo] is used
# to title the block.  Additional styling
# is added so as to conform to LaTeX
# conventions: the body of the block is
# italicized.
